### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a guy that likes to program, with an affinity for Java (to the disdain of a few of my peers).
Most of the things on here will be programs I have made for pet projects, but a few things are from clubs I was in!
I also like learning about the ins and outs of how a programming language works, and want to someday make my own personal language!

### Current projects

    I'm currently working on some projects that I hope to use to teach me about different languages such as C, Java, Python, JavaScript, and Rust!
The project I am on right now is about how to make a 3D game in Java!

### Light APIs
    I've created a few APIs for two mainstream brands of lights, those being Lifx and Philips Hue.  The APIs are mostly finished, but I want to eventually create an API that allows you to make both types of light in the same window.  The Lifx API automatically detects all of the lights on your local network if you have your broadcast IP open, but the Hue API requires you to edit some things in Constants.java and Main.java.
