### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a guy that likes to program, with an affinity for Java (to the disdain of a few of my peers).  
Most of the things on here will be programs I have made for pet projects, but a few things are from clubs I am in!  
I also like learning about the ins and outs of how a programming language works, and want to someday make my own personal language!  

### Projects

I've got a few projects on my back burner that will help teach me about different languages such as C, Java, Python, JavaScript, and Rust!  
For now, I'm focusing on creating code for my robotics team, Blue Cheese 1086.  
Check them out [here](https://github.com/BlueCheese1086)

### Light APIs

My key projects are various APIs for different programmable smart lights.  I have done the most development on Philips Hue and LIFX lights, but plan on upgrading them.  
I also will be working on expanding the ecosystem to Hubspace and Govee lights.  I have a Hubspace python API that I am trying to convert to Java, and Govee work has not started.

### My Website!

I am self-hosting a few things, one of those being my very own website!
